# Bot Privacy Policy

Last updated and effective: February 10, 2021

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot....

**This website does not directly store data but uses Google Analytics. [Analytics Privacy Info](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)**.

---

Stratobot does not store any data. If a server member with the Manage Server permission uses the `prefix` command to change the bot's prefix, then the server's automatically-generated Discord ID (for example, 728813015016669274) will be stored in the bot's database along with the provided prefix. No other data relating to the server is stored. Stratobot never stores data specific to users!

The prefix data is stored only for the bot to function and is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored on repl.

To contact ([me](https://AirSupplier.github.io)), the developer of Stratobot, if you want the data to be removed or for any other reason, you can mention (what you call as ping @AirSupplier#5126) AirSupplier#5126 (7292164288294**42069**) in the official [Support Server](https://discord.gg/kz2ab6RRuk).

See [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

Thanks for using Stratobot!
